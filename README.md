## Data Science Immersive @ General Assembly
This repository is used to store all the projects I worked on as part of General Assembly's 12-week Data Science Immersive programme.

### Project 1: How to increase participation in the SAT?

Here, I analyse the 2017 and 2018 ACT and SAT participation and scoring data to glean insights that the College Board can use to decide which U.S. state to target to increase SAT participation rates.
