## Data Science Immersive @ General Assembly

This repository is a portfolio for the projects I worked on as part of General Assembly's 12-week Data Science Immersive programme from July to October 2020.

### [Capstone project: Personalised recommendations to increase AOV of Instacart loyalists](https://github.com/zixinlee/GA-data-science/tree/master/Capstone)

A  recommender systems project



### [Project 4: Predicting presence of West Nile virus in mosquitos](https://github.com/zixinlee/GA-data-science/tree/master/West-nile-virus)

A classification project



### [Project 3: Classifying subreddit posts](https://github.com/zixinlee/GA-data-science/tree/master/Reddit-classification)

An NLP and text classification project

where I did classification of posts from 2 subreddits (r/AskWomen vs. r/AskWomenOver30). 

- Scraped Reddit posts from 2 subreddits using Reddit's API
- Cleaned text data – removed HTML, punctuation, and non-alphabetical text using regular expressions
- Preprocessed text data – removed stopwords, performed tokenization and lemmatization 
- Fitted

Models used: Logistic Regression, 


### [Project 2: Predicting house prices with regression](https://github.com/zixinlee/GA-data-science/tree/master/House-price-prediction)

**A multiple regression project**

In this project, I have attempted to craft as accurate a model as possible for predicting housing sale prices, using regression techniques, enhanced by feature engineering, feature selection, and regularization. 

Regularization: Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net


### [Project 1: How to increase participation in the SAT?](https://github.com/zixinlee/GA-data-science/tree/master/SAT-ACT-analysis)

**An exploratory data analysis project**

Here, I analyse the 2017 and 2018 ACT and SAT participation and scoring data to glean insights that the College Board can use to decide which U.S. state to target to increase SAT participation rates.
