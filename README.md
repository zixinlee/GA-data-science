## Data Science Immersive @ General Assembly

This repository is a portfolio for the projects I worked on as part of General Assembly's 12-week Data Science Immersive programme from July to October 2020.

### [Capstone project: Personalised recommendations to increase AOV of Instacart loyalists](https://github.com/zixinlee/GA-data-science/tree/master/Capstone) (WIP) 

**A recommender systems project**

For my final capstone project, I chose to explore recommender systems. As a digital native who shops online shopping fairly often, I have been introduced to many new and interesting products –— and spent more than I intended –— thanks to personalised recommendations. Thus, it was of great interest to me to understand the algorithms powering these recommendation systems and try my hand at building one myself. 

### [Project 4: Predicting presence of West Nile virus in mosquitos](https://github.com/zixinlee/GA-data-science/tree/master/West-nile-virus)

**A binary classification project**

In this project, my team of four was tasked to predict the presence of West Nile virus in mosquitos in Chicago city. WNV is a infectious mosquito-borne disease that flares up in summer months. Many of the weather and geographical features provided were irrelevant, so we had to get our creative juices flowing to engineer new features for modelling. Several decision tree and gradient boosting models were tested here.

### [Project 3: Classifying subreddit posts](https://github.com/zixinlee/GA-data-science/tree/master/Reddit-classification)

**An NLP and text classification project**

In this project, I scraped posts from 2 similar subreddits (r/AskWomen vs. r/AskWomenOver30) and examined whether machine learning models were able to classify them accurately. I found that the best model had a decent accuracy of 80%; the top predictive words for each subreddit proved to be a little unanticipated but gave us some insight into the topics discussed there.

### [Project 2: Predicting house prices with regression](https://github.com/zixinlee/GA-data-science/tree/master/House-price-prediction)

**A multiple regression project**

In this project, I developed a regularized regression model for predicting housing sale prices. The dataset had more than 80 features, many of which were categorical, which provided interesting opportunities for enhancing the model performance through feature engineering and feature selection.

### [Project 1: Increasing SAT participation through a data-driven approach](https://github.com/zixinlee/GA-data-science/tree/master/SAT-ACT-analysis)

**An exploratory data analysis and visualisation project**

In this project, I analyse the 2017 and 2018 ACT and SAT participation and scoring data to glean insights that the College Board can use to decide which U.S. state to target to increase SAT participation rates.
